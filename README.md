# Gaurang_Stationary_IMS_Project_ETG

Hi I am Gaurang Ojha, doing my internship in "Elite Techno Groups" organisation for 1 month to work on various industrial application involved projects on Python for ML/AI.

This is my project "Inventory Management System" for a store named "Gaurang's Stationary".
About the Project:
- the file 'Gaurang_Stationary' is used as a inventory of "Gaurang's Stationary",
- the program-file 'Adding_new_products_to_Gaurang's_Stationary.ipynb' is used  to read inventory data from file 'Gaurang_Stationary' and to update the inventory data according to new items comming & added to inventory and after this we update the data of inventory in file named 'Gaurang_Stationary_updated' and return the time and date of updating/adding items to inventory,
- the program-file 'Purchasing_item_from_Gaurang's_Stationary.ipynb' is used to purchase items from "Gaurang's Stationary" and after purchasing the items a bill is generated with total amount and date-time of purchase after that the inventory is updated and stored in file 'Gaurang_Stationary_updated_after_purchase' and also a file 'Gaurang_Stationary_Sales' is generated to store data of sales of the day.

Here in this project we can update the data in the same file 'Gaurang_Stationary' after adding items and after purchasing the items but i have used to different files so as to make everyone clear about the project who so ever visit this.

Thank You For Visiting.
